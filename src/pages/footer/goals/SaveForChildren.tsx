                                Every parent wants to provide their children with sound education, a decent lifestyle, and financial security. However, the cost of education in India is rising at an alarming rate. The cost of undergraduate courses in India ranges from Rs. 8-10 lakhs per annum, and it is even higher for foreign universities. Nivesh helps you build a financial plan that ensures your child's future is secure.

                                The impact of inflation on future education and wedding expenses is significant. Therefore, it is essential to start investing early via SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) to benefit from compounding and beat inflation. The earlier you start, the more time your money has to grow, and the less you need to invest monthly.

                                It is essential to regularly monitor and balance your portfolio. As your child's goal approaches, you should gradually transfer money from volatile equity funds to safer avenues via a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP). This will help safeguard your capital and ensure that you have the funds when you need them.
