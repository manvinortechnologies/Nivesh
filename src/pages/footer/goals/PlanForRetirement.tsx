                                Retirement planning as the name implies requires a lot of planning and a multi-decade effort. While the corpus that you are targeting may seem daunting right now, it is well within the reach if you invest in a disciplined manner. Starting early, choosing good products, avoiding debt, and regularly reviewing your retirement investment plan will help you achieve a worry-free and comfortable retirement. The goal is to build a sizable corpus that lasts at least 25-30 years. It's never too late to start. If you are young and have a higher risk appetite, you can consider equity-oriented schemes. If you are starting late, you should opt for safer options like fixed deposits, debt-oriented schemes. Inflation, lifestyle, and rising medical costs are crucial factors for calculating the retirement corpus.

                                Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) is an ideal way to start retirement planning. You don't need to time the market, and it lowers your investment requirements. It also helps you develop a disciplined habit of saving. The key advantages of SIP are rupee cost averaging and compounding effect. You should consider the amount of time you have till you retire and your risk tolerance. The longer your investment horizon, the lower the SIP amount you need to invest. Starting early and the power of compounding will help you build a substantial corpus. You can also gradually increase your monthly SIP amount.

                                Systematic Withdrawal Plan (SWP) is an option for providing income post-retirement. It allows you to withdraw a predetermined amount monthly.

                                SWP is the opposite of a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP). In SIP, money moves from the bank to the mutual fund, while in SWP, it moves from the mutual fund to the bank. This makes it the best way to seek regular income for retired individuals.

                                    question: 'How much do I need for retirement?',
                                    answer: 'This answer is different for everyone as it depends on the post-retirement expenses and lifestyle of the retiree. However, many financial experts suggest that the simplest way of deciding financial requirements post-retirement is to list down your monthly expenses and calculate the present value of that amount. Then take the inflation rate and calculate the current amount compounded at the inflation rate for the period till you retire. However, most of the time your financial advisor will help you determine this figure.',

                                    question: 'How do retirement mutual funds work?',
                                    answer: 'Retirement mutual funds invest in a mix of securities comprising equity instruments and fixed-income instruments. Generally, there is a lock-in period of 3-5 years. Most of the schemes levy an exit load on redemption before the retirement age and offer a Systematic Withdrawal Plan (SWP) which allows you to withdraw a predetermined amount from your investment every month.',

                                    question: 'How are retirement mutual funds better than traditional pension plans?',
                                    answer: 'To meet the post-requirement expenses, you can opt for a Systematic Withdrawal Plan in your retirement scheme. There is no need to buy an annuity as in the case of the National Pension Scheme or any other pension plan offered by insurance companies. Some of the retirement plans have a 100% exposure to equities whereas NPS restricts equity exposure to 50%. Mutual Funds\' Pension Plans offer greater liquidity as you can withdraw your corpus anytime after the lock-in period.',
